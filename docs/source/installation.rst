Installation
============

1. Download the latest image from the `SamplerBox website <http://www.samplerbox.org/makeitsoftware>`_

2. Write the image to a formatted micro SD card from your PC. Operating system-specific instructions:
 | `Linux <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md>`_
 | `Mac OS <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md>`_
 | `Windows <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md>`_

3. (Optional) If you're not using the official SamplerBox Player hardware, access the SD card on your PC and edit the :ref:`config.ini <config-ini>` found in ``/boot/samplerbox/`` to match your hardware setup. Default config.ini settings are configured for the official hardware.

4. Insert your micro SD card, USB stick with sample-sets, and MIDI keyboard into your Raspberry Pi, and start making some music!
